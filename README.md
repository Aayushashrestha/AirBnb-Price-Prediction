# AirBnb-Price-Prediction


In this project, the goal was to predict the price of Airbnb listings in New York City using machine learning models. Several different machine learning models were employed, including Neural Network, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, K-nearest neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest.

To evaluate the performance of these models, both train-test split and K-fold cross-validation techniques were used. In train-test split, the dataset was divided into training and testing data, with a certain percentage (e.g., 80%) used for training the models and the remaining data used for testing their performance. K-fold cross-validation involves dividing the dataset into k equally sized folds, where k-1 folds are used for training and the remaining fold is used for testing, and this process is repeated k times with different fold combinations.

The performance of the machine learning models was evaluated using common metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R^2). MAE measures the average absolute difference between the predicted and actual values, MSE measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values, and R^2 provides an indication of the proportion of the variance in the target variable explained by the model.

By using multiple models and evaluating their performance using different metrics, it allows for a comprehensive assessment of their effectiveness in predicting the price of Airbnb listings in New York City. This approach helps in identifying the strengths and weaknesses of each model, and enables comparison and selection of the best-performing model(s) for the specific prediction task at hand. It also helps in identifying any potential issues such as overfitting or underfitting, and allows for model refinement and improvement as needed.
